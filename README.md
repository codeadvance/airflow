# airflow
#This is the python script where it activates airflow. 
First off

using Apache Airflow with Docker, including installation and creating a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) file.

Step 1: Install Docker
Download Docker:

For Windows/Mac: Download Docker Desktop from here and follow the installation instructions.
For Linux: Follow the instructions here.
Install Docker:
https://hub.docker.com/

Windows/Mac: Run the downloaded installer and follow the setup steps. Ensure Docker Desktop is running.
Linux: Use the terminal commands from the Docker installation page to set up Docker.
Verify Installation:

Open a terminal (or command prompt on Windows) and run:
sh
Copy code
docker --version
You should see the Docker version information if the installation was successful.
Step 2: Set Up Apache Airflow with Docker
Pull the Apache Airflow Docker Image:

Open a terminal and run:
sh


Then download the main.py and docker-composer.yaml 
Make sure you open these files in Visual Studio Code and run the docker-composer.yaml by right click the file name on the right bar and click compose up. 

This will start running the airflow

Then you create a new folder called DAGS in Airflow-Docker and save Welcome_dag.py in the folder.

The containers that you created in DAG file will show in Airflow application.
